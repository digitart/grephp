# grephp
A useful implementation of grep command in a php interface.
This is a (very) rudimentary code that has help me a lot in more than 14 years to fix, detect problems, make translations and participate with solutions in several closed and open source projects.

Maybe it needs a revamp or a definitve full rewriting, but the original idea was to have a simple monolithic script that can be just uploaded to your root directory, help you during the debuging/fixing stage, and be delated without a trace and without any further cleaning process.
